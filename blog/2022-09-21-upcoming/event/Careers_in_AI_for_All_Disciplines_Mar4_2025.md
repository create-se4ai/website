Join us **on Tuesday March 4th from 1-3PM EST** at 4th Space at Concordia as we explore how students from all disciplines can find their place in AI-related fields, with industry professionals discussing related themes.  The discussion will be followed by a Q&A and a networking session hosted by [CREATE SE4AI](https://se4ai.org/). This event will be both in person and online (live-streamed on YouTube).
