We kicked off the fall semester with a brand new edition of Industry Talks!

**From PoC to Production:** Engineering AI for Regulated Domains

**On Friday, Oct 3, 2025, from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM EDT (Montreal time).**

The session explored how moving AI from proof-of-concept to production goes beyond scaling code or training a model—it involves designing end-to-end architectures that meet safety, security, and compliance standards, especially in regulated sectors such as healthcare, the public sector, and telecom. Speakers shared lessons learned and offered practical tips, frameworks, and tools for deploying AI responsibly and effectively, helping bridge the gap between experimentation and production while supporting adoption in this rapidly evolving field.
