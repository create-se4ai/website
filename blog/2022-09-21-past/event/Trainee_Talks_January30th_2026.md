On <strong>Friday, January 30th at 11:00 AM,</strong> we heard from two MSc students at Polytechnique Montréal under the supervision of <strong>Prof. Foutse Khomh.</strong>
<br/><br/>

**Mo Malekpour** presented his research on Enhancing Text-to-SQL Systems through LLM Routing and Effective Evaluation.


Immediately following, **Sylvain Kouemo** presented his paper titled Chain of Targeted Verification Questions to Improve the Reliability of Code Generated by LLMs.

Each trainee spoke for 20 minutes, followed by a 10-minute Q&A session.

The Trainee Talks are a series of talks featuring the research of CREATE SE4AI program trainees and are open to anyone from inside or outside academia who is interested in learning more about what the students are working on. All current CREATE trainees were strongly encouraged to attend. 

The  Trainee Talk recording is available to view on our [CREATE SE4AI YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5r48NmZuHU&feature=youtu.be).
