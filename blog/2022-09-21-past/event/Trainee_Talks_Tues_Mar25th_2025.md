**On Tuesday, March 25th, at 11:00 AM EDT,** we welcomed Queen’s University Ph.D. student **Adekunle Ajibode.** Adekunle shared his research on “Towards Semantic Versioning of Open Pre-trained Language Model Releases on Hugging Face,” which was recently published in the EMSE journal:
 [ https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10472](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10472).

Immediately after, **Aurel Ikama Honey,** a Ph.D. student at Polytechnique Montréal, presented the preliminary results of his work on “A Comparative Study of LLM Architectures for Root Cause Analysis in End-to-End Test Logs.”

Each trainee spoke for 20 minutes, followed by a 10-minute Q&A session.

The webinar recording is available to view on our [CREATE SE4AI YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNy60i_1zds).
