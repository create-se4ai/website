On **Wednesday, February 26, 2025,**  we had the pleasure of hosting two brilliant minds for our Trainee Talks webinar series. **Altaf Allah Abbassi**, an M.Sc. student at Polytechnique Montr√©al, presented "ReCatcher: Revealing LLM4Code Capabilities Divergence." Following that, **Musfiqur Rahman**, a Ph.D. student at Concordia University, shared insights on "The Impact of Environment Configurations on the Stability of AI-Enabled Systems."

Each trainee spoke for 20 minutes, followed by an engaging 10-minute Q&A session. Thank you to everyone who joined us!
