The Gender Equity Mentoring in AI (GEMinAI) program was launched on Oct. 19, 2023 as a joint initiative between CREATE SE4AI and Concordia’s Applied AI Institute. GEMinAI supports Concordia women+ students who engage with AI by matching them to an industry mentor for advice and assistance along their career journey. The first GEMinAI cohort runs from October 2023 to May 2024.
