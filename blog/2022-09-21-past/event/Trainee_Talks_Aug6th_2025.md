On **Wednesday, August 6th at 11:00AM EDT**, we held a special Summer Edition of Trainee Talks featuring two Concordia University MASc candidates preparing for their thesis defenses.

**Mayra Ruiz** opened the session with her presentation, "File-Level Logging Generation for Machine Learning Applications using LLMs: A Case Study using GPT-4o Mini." She was followed by **Gideon Peters**, who delivered his talk on "Evaluating the Use of LLMs for Automated Resolution of Web Performance Issues."

Both speakers presented for 20 minutes each, followed by a 10-minute Q&A session.
